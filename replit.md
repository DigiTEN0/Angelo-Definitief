Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture

**Framework**: React with TypeScript using Vite as the build tool and development server.

**Routing**: Wouter for client-side routing, providing a lightweight alternative to React Router.

**UI Components**: shadcn/ui component library built on Radix UI primitives, offering accessible and customizable components with the "new-york" style variant. All UI components are located in `client/src/components/ui/`.

**Styling**: Tailwind CSS with custom design tokens defined in `tailwind.config.ts`. The design system follows modern luxury real estate aesthetics with:
- Custom typography using Inter for all text (both headings and body text)
- Sophisticated color palette with neutral tones
- Custom spacing scale and layout constraints
- Elevation effects for interactive elements (hover-elevate, active-elevate-2)

**State Management**: TanStack Query (React Query) for server state management, with queries configured for minimal refetching (staleTime: Infinity, refetchOnWindowFocus: false).

**Form Handling**: React Hook Form with Zod schema validation via @hookform/resolvers for type-safe form validation.

### Backend Architecture

**Server Framework**: Express.js running on Node.js with TypeScript.

**API Design**: RESTful API with routes defined in `server/routes.ts`:
- `/api/properties` - CRUD operations for property listings
- `/api/leads` - Lead management for contact form submissions
- All routes include proper error handling and Zod validation

**Development Setup**: Custom Vite middleware integration for hot module replacement in development, with production static file serving.

**Request Logging**: Custom middleware that logs API requests with duration tracking and response preview (truncated to 80 characters).

### Data Storage

**ORM**: Drizzle ORM with PostgreSQL dialect, providing type-safe database queries.

**Database Client**: Neon Serverless PostgreSQL with WebSocket support for serverless environments.

**Schema Design** (defined in `shared/schema.ts`):
- `users` table - Admin authentication with email/password
- `properties` table - Property listings with comprehensive fields (title, description, price, location, specs, images array, features array, status)
- `leads` table - Contact form submissions with property interest tracking

**Schema Validation**: Drizzle-zod integration generates Zod schemas from database schema for runtime validation.

**Database Abstraction**: Storage interface pattern (`IStorage` in `server/storage.ts`) with `DatabaseStorage` implementation, allowing for potential storage layer swapping.

### Authentication and Authorization

**Admin Authentication**: Simple localStorage-based authentication check for admin routes. The system verifies `admin_authenticated` flag in localStorage before allowing access to admin dashboard, properties management, and leads management.

**Route Protection**: AdminLayout component enforces authentication checks and redirects unauthenticated users to `/admin/login`.

**Note**: Current implementation uses basic authentication suitable for single-user admin scenarios. Production deployments would benefit from session-based or JWT authentication.
